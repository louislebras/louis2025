                <p class="grey">
                    It brings together, in the form of a digital platform, a living index of furniture pieces,
                    exceptional
                    places, and the
                    people who create them: designers, brands, architects, restaurants, hotels, and other key actors of
                    beauty. Its mission
                    is to restore meaning and depth to the digital design experience through a rigorous selection and a
                    demanding editorial
                    approach. <br> <br>

                    We create a new experience, meeting the expectations of a demanding market, by
                    offering
                    both individuals
                    and professionals an unprecedented way to find inspiration, connect with new talents, and conceive
                    and
                    find unique
                    spaces. <br> <br>

                    In the long term, Donzelli aims to become an international reference for spaces, places and people,
                    building a true
                    ecosystem of inspiration and services: a living index for amateurs and professionals, a showcase for
                    furniture creators
                    and editors, and a bridge between brands, architects, and individuals. More than a platform,
                    Donzelli
                    positions itself
                    as a cultural and economic enterprise, dedicated to circulating and growing the value of design over
                    time.

            <span class="subtitle">Heritage</span>
            <div class="other-content-text">
                <h3 class="grey">Rosetta Donzelli was my great-grandmother. <br>
                </h3>
                <p class="grey">
                    A Sicilian merchant, forced to leave her country due to local political reasons. She had to rebuild
                    her life
                    elsewhere, many times. With, as her only wealth and life lesson, her ability to choose — the right
                    objects, the right
                    people, the right places. <br> <br>

                    This heritage truly marked me: Since the age of 3, I have spent one month every year in
                    Italy. There, through my family and my roots, I discovered the taste for things that last: objects
                    passed down,
                    inhabited places, repeated gestures.This heritage shaped me. It became, without me really realizing
                    it, a guiding
                    thread in my life, a way of looking at the world: searching for what has meaning, what endures, what
                    connects people to
                    the places they inhabit.What amazes them. What sparks a light in their eyes during an experience or
                    a moment in
                    life. <br> <br>

                    Today, I carry this vision forward through Donzelli: a curatorial platform that connects furniture,
                    places &
                    people. After starting my career in design and digital agencies in Paris and several years running
                    my
                    own practice, I
                    now want to orchestrate a new chapter for my grandmother’s name. A living, independent index that
                    highlights pieces,
                    designers, and spaces that embody taste, proportions, and volumes that make spaces beautiful and
                    pleasant to live in. <br> <br> I
                    build Donzelli as Rosetta would have seen it: a meeting place between objects, places, and people
                    who give them
                    meaning. <br> <br> Beyond inspiration, I am building Donzelli to restore meaning and depth to the
                    spaces in which we live. They
                    shape who we are and who we become. It is essential to take care of them. The environment is a key
                    to our success. It
                    is time to put an end to cold catalogs and impersonal, insignificant digital experiences. <br> <br>
                    We work in an industry that
                    should inspire people the most — to surpass themselves, to feel at their best, through places that
                    mark their lives. It is up to us to give them the means to do so.
