            He is the creator of <span class="grey">Principle OS™</span>, the culmination of
            nearly a decade of
            research, experimentation, and production
            across design systems, front-end engineering, content architectures, and automation. Principle OS™ a radical
            operating
            system to craft everything on the web in few
            days
            with AI with high
            customization
            including design systems engineering and more: to bring to life and materialize the ideas he envisions
            without limits, with his will as the only obstacle. <br> <br> Alongside this work, he founded <span
                class="grey">Archives
                Bottega®</span>, an independent curatorial platform dedicated to coffee machines,
            tools, places, and rituals. Archives Bottega applies the same logic of structural clarity and long-term
            thinking to
            physical objects and daily practices, documenting tools chosen for their engineering, durability, and
            relevance over
            time.

            <br> <br>

            He has been working with brands, agencies and startups for almost 9 years cumulated. Selected — Nike,
            Kitchen
            Aid, FFF,
            Fraser Yachts... and had the pleasure to challenge them in their conversion system, client journey and brand
            experience.

        <span class="grey">About</span>
        <br>
        Beyond design and engineering, Louis explores long-term thinking around ownership, durability, and autonomy in
        systems:
        whether digital, physical, or economic. His work focuses on building tools, platforms, and frameworks that favor
        clarity, resilience, and independence over short-term optimization. <br> <br>

        His approach consistently bridges craft and systems: understanding how objects are used over time, how
        interfaces shape
        behavior, and how well-designed structures can support autonomy rather than dependency.
